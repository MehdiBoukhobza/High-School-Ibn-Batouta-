# Ibn Batouta High School Web Application

Welcome to the Ibn Batouta High School Web Application project! This is a collaborative effort by El Mehdi Boukhobza and [Your Name] as part of our first-year freelance project for the Software Engineering program at Mohammadia School of Engineers.

## Project Overview

The Ibn Batouta High School Web Application aims to provide a platform for parents to make requests to the school administration and teachers, while also showcasing the school and providing information on the application process. This project is still in development and will undergo further enhancements and improvements.

## Features

- **Parent Requests**: Parents can log in to the platform and submit various types of requests, such as meeting requests with teachers, leave of absence requests, and administrative inquiries.

- **User Authentication**: The web application includes a secure user authentication system to ensure that only registered parents can access the request submission and related features.

- **Administration Dashboard**: An intuitive dashboard allows school administrators and teachers to efficiently manage and respond to parent requests.

- **School Showcase**: The web application features a dedicated section highlighting the school's accomplishments, extracurricular activities, facilities, and other relevant information.

- **Application Process**: Prospective students and their parents can access detailed information on the application process, including admission requirements, important dates, and procedures.

## Technologies Used

This web application is developed using the following technologies:

- **Firebase**: Firebase is utilized as the backend service for user authentication, data storage, and real-time communication between parents, teachers, and administrators.

- **Frontend Development**: The frontend is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

- **Database**: Firebase's Firestore database is used to store and retrieve data related to parent requests, user profiles, and school information.
